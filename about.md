About This Comic:

Just Ducky is Marjorie's third webcomic project. Like her previous works, it is mainly autobiographical with some notable exceptions, such as fictionalized siblings. It will run in two distinct parts: Pembroke , MA 2016-2017 and Denmark 2019-potentially present. As you probably guessed, it's all about ducks and to a lesser extent life in your 30's. Most characters were introduced in her previous works, but no prior knowledge of them is required to enjoy the story.

Her first series, Seeking Shelter, is a semi-fictionalized account of her late 20's focusing on her time fostering cats and leading up to her marriage. It has been compiled into five print voluems and PDFs. The PDFs are available on [GumRoad for a $1 each](https://gumroad.com/marjorie) or you can contact Marjorie to order the print volumes for $15 each or $50 for the whole set, shipping within the U.S. included.

Her second foray into the world of webcomics, Infinite Trouble, is currently only available in PDF form upon request. It is also autobiographical and focuses on pregnancy, with a few dozen post partum strips before it sadly fizzles out.
