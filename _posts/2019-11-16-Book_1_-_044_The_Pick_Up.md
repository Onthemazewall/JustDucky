![44: The Pick Up](/comics/Book_1_-_044_The_Pick_Up.png)

Sometime in my 20's I went to my parent's house in Portland. They were at their summer house at the time and the neighbor came out to tell me the hedge was shaggy and needed clipping. Not understanding the dynamics, I told him if it was bothering him and he wanted to clip it, to just go ahead and I'm sure my parents would understand. When I told my parents they started laughing, apparently the aesthetics of their shared hedge was an ongoing conflict and that the neighbor specifically wanted THEM to deal with it.

Now that my daughter is in nanny group, I've started attacking our endless run of arborvitae as well as other yard maintenance. On one side of our yard is a shared wild plum hedge with our neighbors who have chickens. I don't like it. It's thorny, the fruit are too small to eat and half the year it isn't actually a visual barrier to the yards. Anyway, Thursday while I was taking the Danish 1 exam, said neighbor went all Conan on the hedge. I didn't notice till Friday when I went to continue my onerous task. It's now a good foot shorter and hacked back so aggressively there isn't a leaf left. I'm torn between admiring the beauty of the symmetry and missing its soft, wild former self. He even swept up all the clipping from his handiwork and some from my growing pile of arborvitae detritus. My first reaction was to run to his house, knock on the door and thank him profusely. Then remembering the incident with parents' neighbors, I wondered if this was some sort of passive-aggressive gesture and I'd get shouted at if I knocked on the door. I really have no idea which it is, but I've decided next time I'm baking cookies to just bring a bunch over. I might as well assume it was a nice gesture. After all he, landscapes our elderly neighbor across the street's lawn, because she's not handy, and he knows that with his car for transporting yard waste and bigger tools that he does a far better job than I. Hopefully he won't throw the cookies at me!
