So, a lot to say about today and yesterday's strips...

Yesterday's: For those of you who haven't been following my comics since 2011 (wow, I can't believe I've been writing that long!), my comics are mainly autobiographical, but I don't have an older brother. I have an older sister. When we were kids, me and my two sisters were best friends. They were the most interesting, fun people I knew and we did all sorts of stuff together, but we grew up and grew into very different people. Our hierarchical sibling dynamics were never going to be feasible as adults and the inevitable breakdown sadly set in motion the deterioration of our relationships and as of right now, neither older or younger sister has shown any interest in communicating me for three years and I doubt that's changing anytime soon. 

Anyway, when I started comicking, I decided not to put them in Seeking Shelter, because I felt it would be a landmine field, ironically I think my decision not to put them in also offended them, but I still consider it the lesser of the two evils. So instead I made Robert, Charlotte and Diane, all names my siblings were possibly going to have. My sister, like Burt, is swarthy with wide gauge black curls, extreme myopathy, truckloads of sarcasm and a nearly unhealthy love of books. That's where the similarity ends. Burt is a huge zombie fan, into the softer side of survivalist culture and probably has a couple shotguns full of rocksalt or bird shot in his closet. He's loosely based on the time when my sister taught up in Holton, ME, but whereas she went on to...well, I don't actually know at this point, because as I said it's been more than three years since we communicated, but I'm pretty sure she's not teaching high schoolers up in potato country and if she's publishing novels, I can't find anything recent on Amazon aside from some comics my other sister drew. But I decided for the interstitial strips in between story arcs to do windows into my fictional siblings lives. I figure 30's is the time for fulfilling your dreams, so I kicked it off with Burt becoming a published and successful author, though he shouldn't quit his day job just yet! Wait til you see what I have in store for Lotte...

Today's Strip: Back in Pembroke I had three closest mommy coworkers, three real friends. However for writing a comic, it's really hard to juggle multiple people, especially when the focus is ducks and not toddlers. I ended up choosing "Ife" and her grandma mainly because they are the most fun to draw. The other friend was Swedish and I already have a lot of Western European characters popping up in this comic, while the other one is ethnic Chinese from Indonesia. Her son is half South Shore Irish and while he is adorable and a delight to look at then and now, his character design would be a beast to draw. I didn't have any other African characters and we also had the most comedic How We Became Friends story, so it seemed like the right choice. I really do come on very strong. Most people, both in the U.S. and in Denmark, just give me their numbers and then do the "I'm busy until infinity" dance until I get the hint, "Ife's" grandma was the hardest I ever worked to get someone to trust me enough to actually exchange contact information and it was totally worth it.
