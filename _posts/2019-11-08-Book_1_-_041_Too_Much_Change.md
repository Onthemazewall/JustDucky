![41: Too Much Change](/comics/Book_1_-_041_Too_Much_Change.png)

The amount of major changes my friend made in her thirties really does make my head spin. 

Anyway, life continues to move ahead at light speed here. My daughter started "bespoke daycare" as my house guest called it this week. Said guest was amazed that the toddlers chose their own food and were expected when finished to clean their place at the table and push in their chairs. My daughter loves it, though also got a cold and when today rolled around, she just didn't have the energy to go play with other kids, so she's home with me. Theoretically this means I have five hours a day to myself, however in reality an hour of that is eaten up by biking to and fro, since she has hard times she needs to be there, my son with the more flexible schedule gets dropped off afterwards and then there's the pick ups. The other four hours go impressively fast and it doesn't involve any relaxing. I have I don't know how many yards of hedge that needs all the dead wood removed from it (hopefully a task I never have to repeat since the previous owners damaged them badly by salting the walk) and then trim all that arborvitae (theoretically only a bi-annual task). I also have an entire summer's neglect of trimming other plants, pruning the three fruit trees, doing a last mow of the grass for the season, and general readying the yard for the eternal autumn that is Danish winter. The back porch also needs to be cleaned of the chaos of summer toys, as well as numerous indoor projects like long neglected mending, alphabetizing the DVDs (thankfully a low priority, but we have such a vast collection if you don't do it, you can't find anything.), translating my resume to Danish, job hunting and the normal hours cleaning chores. I've decided to try to take off Mondays and deferred proper job hunting until January in hopes that I can get everything in good shape before then. I'll say this, life is never dull once you have kids!
