![51: Need Babies](/comics/Book_1_-_051_Need_Babies.png)

Thank you everyone for being patient with my slightly erratic posting schedule. I really thought by now I would consistently be getting enough sleep and thus have the energy to be on top of this, but sadly this is not the case. Eventually my daughter will start sleeping through the night, right?

So, I continue my quest for good middle grade Danish books to read. I asked a friend with an 11 year old daughter and got recommended a horse series (I'll give it a go) and anything by Astrid Lingrid, who coincidentally, whose books I just checked out at the library (well, a couple, she is quite prolific). However I pointed out that she's Swedish, what was the Danish equivalent? My friend drew a blank and then suggested Hans Christian Andersen. While it is totally true that they are both the most famous authors from their countries, I hate to think Sweden is characterized by Pipi Longstocking and more contemporary sweet, wondrous children's adventures, while Denmark is characterized by a noble snob who wrote countless bleak stories with the moral of "know thy place, commoner!". I mean, despite the enduring popularity of his works, they aren't exactly feel good stories or anything that would motivate me to pick up a book. Ah well, I did stumble across a great book the other day Trolddom og Falkfjier (sorcery and falcon feathers) that was a real page turner. It took place in medieval Denmark and was the travails of a common girl who accidentally got wrapped up in an evil sorceresses' plot to turn her lord's son into a falcon and her efforts to turn him human again. It had 4 page chapters, gorgeous illustrations and I appreciated that it ended with her saving the noble, him giving her an insulting marriage offer and her turning him down. More books like that please!
