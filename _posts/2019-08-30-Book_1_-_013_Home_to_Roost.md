![13: Home to Roost](/comics/Book_1_-_013_Home_to_Roost.png)

There were a number of people in our neighborhood in Pembroke who had chickens. One I knew of because I'd hear the rooster in the morning and it took me and my son months to actually find their house (I used to wander down all the long driveways to see what was at the end). Another was pretty obvious, they had quite the flock and used to let them free range on the lawn, till my husband and I had to chase a fox away in the early morning light and then there was this family...their chickens had unsupervised outdoor time. Their yard wasn't fenced or hedged and they'd just let them out in the morning and hope they came home at sunset. Aside from irritating the neighbors, this clearly did not end well for the chickens. We lived in a heavily wooded area with hawks, fisher cats and innumerable foxes. The houses were all on one acre parcels, so pretty spread out and conducive to happy wildlife.
