![17: She's Everywhere](/comics/Book_1_-_017_She's_Everywhere.png)

This weekend we went to a birthday party for the kids' friend Luke, who was turning three. His mom is from Uganda and his dad Danish. Most of the guests were Central Africans and much to everyone's surprise, I knew about half of them! It's amazing how a town of 40,000 really can feel so very small. I absolutely can't leave the house anymore without running into somebody that I know.
