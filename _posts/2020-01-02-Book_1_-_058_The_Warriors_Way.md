We came back to Denmark on New Year's Eve. After we debarked the extremely loud plane we were greeted by the tranquility of the country we hope to call home forever, no blaring advertisements on a 10 second loop, no horrible music blaring on loud speakers or unnecessary messages calling for our attention. Even the appliances and other necessary background noises were quieter. I never noticed it before we left, but I now love the hygge quietude of Denmark. When we were in the U.S., public places felt like a constant aural assault and I am now quite convinced American insurance won't pay for hearing related medical expenses, because they know the whole country is going deaf from the excessive cacophony of public spaces. 

In the train station I bought the kids Dunkin' Doughnuts, the 3 dollar price tag no longer seems outrageous after my promises of doughnuts every day turned out to be high fructose corn syrup rings of disappointment. On the train, there were several other families with small children on the car. No one yanked their baby away from my children's curious caresses, fearing germs and visits both mentally and financially painful to the doctor's office. Instead they smiled and encouraged our children to interact with their younger peers. Everyone smiled and wished us a good trip before going their separate ways, a far cry from the cold treatment in the U.S. where when a conversation ended it was like we became invisible. 

New Year's day I walked into town to drop off some library books. I ran into the Moroccan woman whose name I've never memorized. I have her cell phone number, but I doubt we'll ever manage a play date for our boys. She raced across the empty cobbled street to greet me with a big hug and catch up. I hugged her back as warmly and we did the social dance before going our separate ways. All this, because we met and chatted once in the library and then in our town of 40,000 keep running into each other again and again. This is is such a constant occurrence, to run into an acquaintance of some stripe when I'm out, that it's unusual for this not to happen. In Jersey, where every destination must be attained by car, you never gain this closeness to your town.

Today I've biked for more than an hour, taking care of various errands around town. I suspect this may be more exercise than I had in my entire 12 day trip to the United States.
