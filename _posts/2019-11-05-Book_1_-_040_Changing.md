My apologies for the tardy post. I had one of my closest friends visiting from the U.S. and by the end of the week I was just out of momentum. It's one of the biggest downsides of having small children, because you don't ever get a vacation and you have a job that is more than 12 hours a day with unpredictable night shifts, something that should be pure joy, like a friend visiting for a week, ends up being a mixture of happiness and sheer exhaustion with obligations all sliding into an avalanche as the visit goes on. Especially since for unknown reasons, everything time someone visits my daughter has a particularly bad night where I get woken something like 5 times and then can't recover, because I'm not going to take a nap when someone flew all the way to Denmark to visit me! So yeah, life happened.

On a more exciting note, my daughter just started at nanny group or "bespoke daycare" as my friend who was visiting called it. She loves it and I have many more hours in the day to myself.
