Would love some feedback. Editor suggested I should put little English subs under the Chinese. I debated and ultimately decided not, because aside from the text being unexciting "turkey! Turkey! Yes there's a turkey. Chicken!", MangaPro no longer supports Chinese characters, which is weird considering it's a Japanese program, so I had to do the characters in Acorn and its much more annoying to edit text across two programs. So please let me know if it is obnoxious to have random Chinese text in a comic.

If you're wondering why Louis speaks Chinese, I have an Infinite Trouble comic I can repost about it. Essentially though, I taught him Mandarin, because it's easier than English. Hungry is "euh", cat is "mao" etc. lots of one syllable open sounds and unsurprisingly he picked it up faster. I used it like a lot of people use sign language, it just didn't require me learning a whole new language. For a while Chinese was dominant and then English pulled ahead, because of way more exposure and he turned out to have a love of long words
