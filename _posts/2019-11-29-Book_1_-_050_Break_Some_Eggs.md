![50: Break Some Eggs](/comics/Book_1_-_050_Break_Some_Eggs.png)

I am struck recently by how there are some really amazing kids cartoons coming out. We bought The Rocketeer cartoon series for our children, it's gender balanced, has a very cool stereotype defying lead and is in general a fun show. What impresses me the most is how diverse the cast is. The main character is half European-Middle Eastern (denoted by her swarthy complexion and her mom calling her "habibi"), her best buddy is could be Middle Eastern, South Asian or half African, but at any rate he's very brown. The town is actually 50% European 50% other ethnicities, though mainly African-American and that just gives it a really cool feel. Like it represents everybody's America.

The same could be said for DC's new superhero girls. The cast is very diverse and so much love has been lavished on the character designs, denoting ethnicity and individuality. My favorite character has quickly become Green Lantern. Aside from having an awesome character design (yes, I'm a sucker for a character in a long flowy dress and loose top), she's a genuinely good person. Like not just a moral, good samaritan fighting crime when duty calls, she actually spends her free time trying to save the environment and volunteering at animal shelters. Speaking of which, the latest episode about an unadaptable cat reminded me a whole lot of my experiences with my furry buddy Rab Cat. Really worth a watch if you're a cat fan!
