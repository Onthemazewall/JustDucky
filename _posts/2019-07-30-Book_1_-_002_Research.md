Thanks to everyone who reached out to me about bing excited about the launch of a new comic. I am totally psyched. We're having a bit of a heat wave in Denmark right now, which by Massachusetts standards is kind of laughable. The weather has been in the 80's with a lovely breeze in the afternoon. My daughter's bonus bedstemor, extra grandma, took Beatrix to the beach the other day. She had a ball. I took advantage of having a kidless few hours to walk down the boat ramp at the harbor down the street and dog paddle about the estuary for half an hour. The water wasn't as cold as I like, but it was a wonderful salty interlude.
