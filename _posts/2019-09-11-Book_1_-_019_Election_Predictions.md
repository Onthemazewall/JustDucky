Yeah, that election so broke my entire impression of the country I was born into. I genuinely thought until Trump won that bigotry was an aged relic of past generations and that if we let go of the paranoia inherited from our parents that our kids could be the first generation free of all that crap. Certainly all my stories of anti-semitism were from my parents generation and I had reason to believe that on the South Shore where black families seemed as wealthy, if not wealthier than white, that the same was true for their community as well. I was wrong, so wrong. Getting into podcasts coincided with the lead up to the election and that's when I started learning about the true depth of institutional racism. It's when I found out black authors writing genre fiction with black protagonists, like romances, couldn't even get published until the 90's. It's when I found out red lining was still going on and that a large part of why the civil rights movement succeeded was the Deacons, a group of black people who were the muscle behind the movement, threatening the threateners of violence to keep them in check. It's when I realized that all the Native Americans hadn't been killed off, but it was simply the narrative perpetuated by my upbringingI and mainstream American culture to keep people from really thinking about colonialism and its legacy. It was very upsetting, but it made the 2016 election make sense, the realization that this was in some ways the backlash to finally having an African American president, how much civility ends up being the cover people use for being horrible and how we got where we are today with concentration camps in the United States and an actual kleptocratic presidency. I still think I'm right in that if every minority had voted, even every woman, even with the Russian interference, Trump would have lost, but I did not realize the true extent of apathy, election machine tampering and voter suppression that goes on in America. I suppose it's not surprising that the 65 year old black woman whose family has been in America since the Europeans first came exploring and had the good sense after the civil war to relocate to Boston in search of a better life, which they achieved, knew more than a 35 year old Mainer born into privilege. May this be the dark before the dawn.
