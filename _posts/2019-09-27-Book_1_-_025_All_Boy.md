![25: All Boy](/comics/Book_1_-_025_All_Boy.png)

I have been on impressive sleep deprivation bender. I had a few bad nights before we left for Norway, then the Norway trip had a high sleep cost and now I'm having to retrain my daughter to go to sleep with us not in the room and sleep through the night. This has had a devastating effect on my creativity, thank goodness for massive buffers!

In other news, we've been touring the private schools in the area, there are really only two that were viable options, one a 15 minute bus ride away and one a 15 minute bike ride. The bus ride away one had beautiful facilities, rolling hills, old buildings, a spacious library, lots of toys in the smallest children's classroom and a no-tech policy. A little boy who had just moved from Scotland immediately befriended my son and literally took him by the hand. The tour guide talked a good talk, but when we tried out a class I was underwhelmed by the lack of teaching. 

The 15 minute bike ride school was totally diffent. The building was run down, the playground was cramped and lacking, there was a TV in every classroom and they seemed to love tests. The six students in the kindergarten class were all immediately friendly and interested in my son. The teacher was constantly taking raised hands and helping the kids, including my son. When he discovered my son can't draw (something that was news to me), he instead had him sculpt numbers out of clay with another student. It's not the Montessori school of my childhood, but my high functioning autistic son seemed to love it and I was so impressed by how nice everyone was. At recess, which is classes 0-9 together, one of the kindergarteners I was playing tag with fell and was immediately swarmed by teenagers checking to see if she was OK. If the public school ends up being too overwhelming for him, this seems like a perfect breakwater for him to spend a few years at while he gets his crowd anxiety under control. Also, get this, private school costs only $300 a month, the same as his b√∏rnehave! It feels so much more doable than in the U.S.!
