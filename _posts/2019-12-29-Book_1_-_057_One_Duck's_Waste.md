![57: One Duck's Waste](/comics/Book_1_-_057_One_Duck's_Waste.png)

I find this weird, but I have met people who are grossed out instead of reassured that eggs from unfertilized birds are essentially menses.

Well, our trip the US ends tomorrow and I am very eager to get back to my own house, own bed, own food, routines and the familiarity of Denmark. I had not thought 2.5 years was enough to feel like stranger in the country you grew up in, but apparently it is. Among other things, all the food tasted like cardboard or chemicals, even the produce. I'd promised the kids endless Dunkin' Doughnuts, but it's made with high fructose corn syrup here and they did not like that. Everything seems loud, maybe this is why health insurance won't pay for anything related to hearing, because I think the whole country is going deaf from music blaring from stores and public spaces and people yelling to be heard over it. American architecture has abysmal acoustics. I also was more miserable than I thought trading in 1 hour+ of daily exercise for being trapped in a metal box. I had not realized how much benefit I get out of biking and walking everywhere. There also have been more anti-Semitic events in the New York halo, where we're staying, than nights of Chanukah. In short, I appreciate Denmark so much more now and can't wait to get home!
