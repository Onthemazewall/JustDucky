![46: Private Party](/comics/Book_1_-_046_Private_Party.png)

This is one of my favorite strips. I have read somewhere that there's no such thing as homosexual ducks, just ones doing "practice" mating. I beg to differ.

My son brought home his first free form drawing yesterday. I was so proud of him. It's a picture of a vacuum-like contraption that sucks up leaves and features what are clearly leaves from several different types of plants. According to his pedagog the assignment was to draw a face expressing emotions. I'm not sure why she thought the faceblind, autistic child, was going to want to draw a face, but I'm very proud of him for not only drawing something, but something creative. 

In other news we've finally gotten our daughter to say her name is Beatrix instead of Big Kid. Major improvement. Her favorite game right now is the "who does so and so love?" "Daddy loves Mommy" "Daddy loves Big Kid" etc etc. At this age her brother like to talk about dodecahedrons and octagons....Different kids!
