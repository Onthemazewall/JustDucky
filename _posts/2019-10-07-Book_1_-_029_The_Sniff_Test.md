![29: The Sniff Test](/comics/Book_1_-_029_The_Sniff_Test.png)

My parents always had a zero tolerance policy for violence for us. I get why, but having been the victim of a bully in elementary school and really in retrospect that I could have put an end to the whole thing with a punch, I have not enacted the same policy with my kids. We have a "no throwing hard things" rule and a "no force multipliers" rule, but as long as neither seems to be actually getting hurt, I let them hit each other a little, especially since it's my daughter, the younger one who inevitably initiates it. 

I had to ask my son though, why he had no problem exchanging punches with his sister, but at b√∏rnehave why he lets kids bite, punch, push and otherwise perform acts of aggression upon him without retaliation. The answer was so obvious, I was shocked. He can't fight back at nursery school, because they have an anti-bullying policy. It's against the rules to do any of these things. So he suffers the double distress of being physically assaulted and having to deal with rule breakers. It's the autism thing. Things are black and white. There are no exceptions or extenuating circumstances. You follow the rules. I feel so relieved now understanding what the problem is, now I just have to figure out how to solve it.
