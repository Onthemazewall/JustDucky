![28: What's in a Name](/comics/Book_1_-_028_What's_in_a_Name.png)

So on the subject of names, one of the dads I always talk to at b√∏rnehave just became a father again. He now has three sons: Mulubrahan, Meron and Thomas. Walter's buddy, Dotan, became a big brother recently, his little sister is named Abagail. I had to ask if they had given their youngest European names instead of Eritrean names. I was told, no, they were all names from the bible, which of course makes them good names in an Muslim/Jewish/Christian country. I had never realized. Apparently Mulubrahan is a different interpretation of "Abraham", while Dotan and Meron are both just biblical references I'm not familiar with. I still have to wonder if the youngest children, born in Denmark, got names that had stronger crossover power, but it's still really neat to me. It gives all their names so much more context. My kids have Hebrew names, but they are separate from their international names.
