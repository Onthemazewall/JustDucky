![36: Bro Disatisfaction](/comics/Book_1_-_036_Bro_Disatisfaction.png)

I continue to struggle over the decision of which school to send my son to. It's a fascinatingly emotional experience. Obviously, I want to do what's best for my child, but my decision will have a fundamental timpact on my life. Right now, all my patterns focus on the Northeast part of town. My choice of grocery stores, which I visit 3-4 times a week, my choice of parks and errands in general. However, if my son goes to the private school, then my daughter will go to the børnehave on that side of town and suddenly the grocery stores on the Southwest side of town will be closest (we have two major grocery stores in the town center, one on the west side and one on the east), I'll end up going to the mall on the southside instead of the northside, I'll probably favor the hardware store on that side of town and actually the last bakery in town happens to be on the same street as the kids' possible future schools. I spend so much time right now on the Northeast side of town that when I invited a new friend, met through the børnehave like 85% of my acquaintances, she had trouble finding the house, because she was convinced it had to be on the East side of town since every time she's run into me, that's where I am. The demographics of the different parts of the city also vary wildly, so it would be interesting to see if we'd go from having more African acquaintances to Middle Eastern. Anyway, I just never realized when you started a family that everything would be so intertwined that things like choosing a school would end up being a whole family impact decision!
