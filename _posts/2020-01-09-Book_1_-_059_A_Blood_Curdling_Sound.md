In case you're wondering, yes this really happened and, yes, I'm crazy enough to run towards the horrible sound.

The PJ Library sent me the book Outwitting History by Aaron Lansky, "the amazing adventures of a man who rescued a million yiddish books", though by his count it's between 1-5 million books! It's surprisingly engrossing and educational. As I read it, I find myself having the old internal debate about langauage. On the one hand, language is a unique way of expressing culture and shaping your mindset. Language is even a unique way of defining culture, it's one of the things I bring up when I have to explain to people that, yes, Judaism is a religion like Islam or Christianity, however Jews also have their own culture. Religions do not have their own language. I actually regret that my parents broke the chain and never taught me yiddish, on the other hand, would I then be raising my kids tri-lingual now? Who would they speak yiddish with aside from me? Moreover, there is great power in the unity of speaking the same language. The United States' greatest strength is their media exports and a large part of the reason they have such a powerful media output is the vast population speaking the same language. Common language unites. Theoretically the less languages in the world the closer we become. I really don't know if there's a right answer, but at the end of the day, I'm glad this fellow saved so many yiddish books from obscurity and am going to see what I can find translated into English!
