My husband drew my attention to this topic this morning and it really freaks me out. In principal, yes, I absolutely agree that Hebrews are an ethnicity, not simply a religion and the acknowledgement of that is great. After all Jews practice many religions and a lot of us are agnostic or atheist, while still observing the important cultural holy days and traditions. However, what terrifies me is there seems to be some sort of implicit understanding that by this declaration all Jews are Israelis. I mean, 20% of Israel is made up of Arabs, more if you consider that Palestinians are actually Israelis. (I have no opinion on one or two state solution, just as long as everyone is treated fairly). To be Israeli is absolutely not to be Jewish and there are as many Jews who have chosen not to become a part of the nation of Israel as those who have made the opposite decision. I strongly object to being made a de facto Israeli. Moreover I am extremely bothered that this then means that essentially it has been codified that Jews have "dual loyalties", since now every Jew is considered to also be an Israeli. How messed up is that? Are they going to start marking our passports like Russia does? Are we going to going to take a page from history and suddenly the new Chinese Exclusion Act will be the Jew Exclusion Act? Yeah, there is something nice about not having to constantly argue that Judaism is more than just a religion that we are a genuine culture, and having better tools to fight anti-semitism is great, but I worry this is just going to foment more left-wing anti-semitism of blaming every Jew for the sins of a less than 100 year old nation we are not from and emboldening right wing white supremecist anti-semitism that we have now been officially acknowledged as a different race.
