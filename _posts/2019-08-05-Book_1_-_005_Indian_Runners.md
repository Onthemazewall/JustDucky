![5: Indian Runners](/comics/Book_1_-_005_Indian_Runners.png)
In the Massachusetts I feel like I had near infinite choice of duck breeds if I looked long enough and that's without even getting into hatcheries. Here on Sj√¶lland it's a lot more limited. Muscovies seem to be the most popular type of duck as I've stated, I think they're just freaky looking. Plus I've learned unlike domestic Mallard types, you need to clip their wings to keep them from flying away. I'm sure they are proficient egg layers, but not legendary and I'm not into raising them for meat like most people around here. Danish Farm Ducks AKA Swedish Blacks but with every coloring under the sun, are also pretty prevalent. They're also meat ducks, I'm not sure how they are as layers, but since we have a smaller plot of land here, I'm not into huge ducks. You can get Long Island ducks too and I know someone who has real Rouens, not the runty Mallards who can't fly that are called Rouens back in the 'states, but genuine jumbo Mallard patterned meat ducks. I was tempted, but the third most popular duck here are Runners. How lucky that the breed I've always wanted to most were one of the most readily available here! Now I'm not sure I'll ever attain my Cayuga dreams, but I'm pretty darn happy.
