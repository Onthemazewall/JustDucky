![31: Privation](/comics/Book_1_-_031_Privation.png)

To be fair, this is the only person I know who managed to pay off all of his student debt (mostly to parents, so interest free) within like three years of getting a job. Being able to live a live of extreme privation does have its upsides!

I went for a woods walk recently and found myself by a gate that said "Please keep closed so that wild animals don't get onto the grounds." I went through the door, realized how far I was from the road and walked back to the gate. On the way, I spotted a totally stressed out deer who had somehow ended up on the wrong side of the fence and suddenly all these precautions to keep the wildlife out, where trapping her in there. The best laid plans...
