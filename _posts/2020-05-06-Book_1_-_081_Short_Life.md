![81: Short Life](/comics/Book_1_-_081_Short_Life.png)
This weekend the prime minister is supposed to announce the next phase of reopening. I've seen reports by the health ministry that libraries, zoos and museums are all on the low risk list and I am crossing my fingers that they make the cut. Most of the holidays in Denmark are in May and June. It feels like there's barely a 5 day workweek, so having zoos and outdoor museums to add to our list of places to go would be huge. We went to the local palace and grounds last weekend and they've never been so packed. People were doing a good job social distancing up until the zip lineI told the staff that they need to put out hand sanitizer and make lines like for the grocery store, because 8 year olds aren't great at reading and you can't expect them to understand how to do a post COVID-19 line without guidance. 

I also would like to be able to keep my kids in reading material without having to keep buying books. My sons preschool teacher wanted me to get him the book they're reading "Hittegods" in English, so it's a translated work and she thought he'd be more engaged if Mommy read it to him at bedtime, but Thebookdepository's free shipping takes 3 weeks and with Amazon.de being slammed, I actually ended up paying 8 bucks for expedited shipping, so that it will get her before they unit ends. If the library was open, I could have checked out a copy and translated it back into English on the fly. Oy. I also ended up ordering a pencil case as an Eid present for his new school buddy. He wanted her to have a cool one like him with a triangle ruler (right now she uses the school materials) and was surprisingly opinionated about the design. He rejected unicorns, butterflies and finally picked an owl in pink and teal. I'm going to take it as a good sign that he put so much thought into it.
