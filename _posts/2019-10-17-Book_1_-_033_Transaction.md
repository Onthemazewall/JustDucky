So this morning I was sewing a button onto the crotch of my son's armadillo to represent his penis, because Walter was concerned that the Armadillo couldn't pee without one. He asked me why they hadn't made the stuffed armadillo with a penis to begin with. I was reminded again of the weird sexualization of bodies that Americans do. I had to explain that it might have been because that was extra work and complication, but in general Americans, who most toys are made for, are uncomfortable with penises and vulvas, which reasonably baffled him. I assume this goes back to that Christian idea that we are born with sin and that normal bodily functions are somehow shameful. I'm so glad I'm raising my kids in Scandinavia where that's not a thing.

My daughter doesn't have a particularly large vocabulary yet. I think her favorite word is "pile", because it's an abstract concept she learned from Kahn Academy Kids, but of these maybe 200 words she can say, include 
"Katy Perry" "Janelle Monae" and "Black Pink". The kid loves her music videos.

On Monday we had a play date with the kids friends who are Ugandan-Danish. They ran around the house while the mom taught me to make Ugandan crepes. Like most people from British colonial countries, I feel very comfortable, because we have the juxtaposition of belonging to very old cultures that got influenced by potentially the father of all toxic cultures with the added bonus of rural upbringings. Admittedly hers much more than mine. When I asked if food was seasonal like in Denmark, she dryly answered that since they had to grow everything they ate, yes, very. In the course of conversation my son's neurologically atypical state came. I started explaining the saga and she cut me off, confused and a bit dismissive, why in the world would people be upset by his behaviors? It seemed totally within the realm of normalcy to her. And yes, it is. That's the thing, right? All this hysteria about rising rates of autism in developed countries is because we've created societies with very rigid sets of what types of behavior are appropriate to become an successful adult, whereas in more rural countries that rely mainly on substance farming autism just isn't a problem. In fact, it could be an advantage, you could be that weird lady obsessed with tractors who everyone goes to to get their tractors fixed who cares if you don't make eye contact and have your barn entirely alphabetized and color coded? Vaccines don't cause autism, restrictive societies with a narrow path for everyone to walk label it.
