![78: Problem Solved](/comics/Book_1_-_078_Problem_Solved.png)

I hate Facebook. And not just because it tends to bring out people's narcissistic qualties where they just announce things instead of really interacting with people, because truth is some people use Facebook beautifully and it is something that enriches and strengthens their relationships. And not because it seems to be surprisingly biased in its political leanings and push propoganda, because you can be very discerning in who you follow and actually get some quite good information via friends on Facebook. No, I'm not even complaining today about everyone talking about Facebook like it's the go-to place to solve all your problems, because it has been amazing for promoting my kendo club. No, my complaint today is just that it's really badly coded. According to my husband they are fairly infamous for it. They are HATEFUL to use if you're trying to make a page. I am going to have to make my THIRD page for my kendo club, none of the older ones have bee deleted (because I can't figure that out either), simply because the UX is so terrible. The help function is rarely helpful, if you don't do it all at once, important feature options disappear and if you make a mistake, you are stuck with it forever. I have been trying to edit the original page for weeks, only to say, heck I'll make a new one, made a mistake there and now I have to make a third one. Come on, there's no reason this stuff should be set in stone! Seriously bad design.
