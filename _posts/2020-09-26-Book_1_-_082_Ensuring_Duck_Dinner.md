![82: Ensuring Duck Dinner](/comics/Book_1_-_082_Ensuring_Duck_Dinner.png)

So the comic is back! I've got two weeks worth of strips in the bag and have started producing more and have scripts for the rest of the arc, so hopefully, this will be on track for the rest of it's run. When I started the webcomic, my daughter had started sleeping better and I thought I was out of the woods. Ha. Ha. Ha. NOW, I'm pretty sure she is going to continue to actually sleep through the night and I'm relatively well rested. My sleep has been broken so long that I'm getting up at 5 AM, but, eh, a little morning me time isn't so bad. Hope you all are doing as well as can be expected in this very weird year...
