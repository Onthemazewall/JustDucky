![34: Box of Surprises](/comics/Book_1_-_034_Box_of_Surprises.png)

To this day I wonder how that guy shoved those birds in that little box. Did he drug their feed and put them in unconscious? I am not exaggerated, they were nestled in that box like figurines and I can tell you those drakes were anything but tame.

It doesn't make it into the comic, but originally we kept their coop outside of the fenced yard. It seemed like a good idea to maximize their roaming space even by that little bit more, but herding them was not easy, they not only didn't want to go where I wanted them to, but if I moved to fast they'd fly off on me. After a couple weeks we realized the coop definitely needed to be inside the yard.

We had a whole acre of property and about half of that was fenced, it was quite the good roaming grounds. I think we have about half that now. The ducks have explored every inch of it. Sometimes you can walk by the house and they'll be in the unused driveway at the far edge of the yard, the only part without a hedge and neighbors get a good look at what makes the mysterious quacking noises all day. Everyone seems to love our ducks. They are much more present than our neighbor's chickens, which are nearly silent and I think never leave their coop.
