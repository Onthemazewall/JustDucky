![9: Fern](/comics/Book_1_-_009_Fern.png)

Yay! The comic is back in action. My editor has finished sitting shiva and I have properly polished strips again, sooner than expected, hurray! 

For the record, I keep poison control in Favorites on my cell phone and activated charcoal in the cabinet, thanks to that fern incident. Since then I've called three times more, once because Walter ate some holy berries, once because Beatrix got into some medicated creamand once because she picked up a bee and got the stinger stuck in it (for the record, I first tried our doctor, the emergency doctor and our friend the retired nurse, but none of them were available to give me answers) . The Danish counterpart is almost exactly like the American one, very calm, competent and quick to tell you if your worries are founded or not. For the record, I've never had an issue that actually required action. The closest probably being when Irving the foster cat drank from the freshly cleaned and blued toilet....
