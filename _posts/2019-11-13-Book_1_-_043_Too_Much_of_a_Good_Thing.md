![43: Too Much of a Good Thing](/comics/Book_1_-_043_Too_Much_of_a_Good_Thing.png)

Last night as we were dinning on roast broccoli (seriously, if you haven't tried drizzling oil on broccoli and roasting it for 30 minutes you are really missing out!) I realized that I need to add a veggie section to my cookbook. Oh yeah, I decided to take advantage of my self publishing expertise and have a perpetually edited version of my own cookbook. I'm on to my 11th revision. It keeps all the recipes I use in daily life and someday when my children are grown up, I'll give them a copy before they leave home. Anyway, I don't really have a vegetable section, because most of the preps are so simple, but on the other hand it's not exactly intuitive. As a kid we ate a lot of cut corn, which my husband tells me is not a vegetable. If it wasn't that it was steamed peas, which I still think are disgusting or tomato sauce or...I can't really remember any other vegetables. I think because they were all mushy steamed messes. Sorry Mom. In China I learned the art of saut√©ing vegetables and my years of cooking magazine subscriptions has really broadened my horizon. 

I consider eggplant, squash and potatoes to all be the carb of the meal, but we have a truly exciting rotation of vegetables. They can be split into things best roasted: brussel sprouts, cauliflower, broccoli (which it occurs to me are all in the same family, probably not a coincidence), things best served fresh and sliced, maybe with some salt: kohlrabi, radishes, cucumbers, carrots, things that need to be cooked in fat: cabbage, kale, and things best thrown into the pan with the food: snow peas, green beans, peppers, bok choy. I suppose salad is the last category, but I feel like it speaks for itself. The right preparation can totally transform a vegetable and make it as exciting as the main dish.
