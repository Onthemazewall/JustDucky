![69: Happy at Last](/comics/Book_1_-_069_Happy_at_Last.png)

My ceilings have spiders on them. I don't like killing bugs and I decided to see if we could live together. Two years later, we have maybe a few more cobwebs than before, but the house isn't full of dead bugs or overrun with arachnids, they're actually very good housemates. The kids even get excited when a new type moves in, which inevitably leads to them scaring off said new resident and thus we only have these spindly Daddy Long Legs types. I'd recommend to anyone to try befriending the spiders in their homes instead of squashing them.
