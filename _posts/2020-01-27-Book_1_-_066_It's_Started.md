![66: It's Started](/comics/Book_1_-_066_It's_Started.png)

Much has been going on. Over the weekend, my son went to Taekwondo and it was amazing. The head teacher, the founder, was there and it was like an entirely different class. He had seme, he used kiai, he did all the drills with the kids and the drills were all practical. It was real martial arts. My son was adorable bad, because, you know, he's five, youngest kid in the class and just started, but there was something so cute about watching him repeatedly fall down and roll on the floor like a bear cub. I'm very sad that the founder's kids have aged out and he rarely teaches the kids class anymore.

So, I'm still planning on starting a kendojo and the amazing head of the mainland dojos is helping me with the charter. I am overflowing gratitude at how helpful he has been. There are a lot of moving parts in the process and I am scrambling to get everything nailed down, but I will prevail!

On Saturday, I tried to make friends with another immigrant family, new to NÃ¦stved, a common endeavor of mine with a very mixed success rate. Since I've had trouble with families being concerned that food I bring isn't halal, this time I stopped at one of the Arab markets, told them I was going to an Iraqi familie's house for the first time and asked what I should bring. I was steered towards rose flavored Turkish delights and crackers, which the shopkeeper said you at like sandwiches. He actually offered to pay if the price tag was too expensive, but less than 10 USD didn't seem that much for such an adventure.

I'd tried to arrange a playdate for the kids before, but the wife had never answered my text with more than a bunch of encouraging emojis. She had, however, pointed out where her house was several times, so I just walked us over there and knocked on the door. The father, who speaks English, answered and there was some concern about whether we should come in, because the kids were getting over some flu-like cold. Since Walt is classmates with the older boy, I decided they'd already been exposed and in we went. Besides, people are most contagious before they're symptomatic, not at the end of a virus!

The father's face lit up like the son when I preferred the sweets and we did the "You shouldn't have" "I wanter to!" dance. The kids immediately started playing together, their two boys are almost exactly the same age as mine two. My son is fairly terrible at playing with kids in big groups, but great one on one. It turns out that they're Kurdish and despite the mother's protest to the contrary, if you speak slowly and there isn't a ton of ambient noise, her Danish is quite solid.

A huge spread of snack foods was put out, something else I've learned along the line is that unlike a Jewish house, where the expectation is you should eat until you can eat no more, Arab homes tend to put out more than enough food, but you aren't expected to eat all you possibly can. So I nibbled on stuff and drank the delicious Kurdish tea, which is similar to the Moroccan tea I had at the West Saharan household, but a lot less sweet.

It was a nice visit, got to hear their story, we compared being Iraqi refugees vs. American, kids, etc. The mother told she'd been here 5 years and had no friends, to be fair, she said with much happiness that she has her kids and her lifemate, so was very fulfilled, but being the extrovert that I am, I made sure to tell her as I was leaving that she now had a friend in Denmark and not to hesitate to call. Hopefully she will!
