![48: Fox Food](/comics/Book_1_-_048_Fox_Food.png)

I don't think I could ever manage to be a soccer mom. This morning I went to drop the kids off at school. My son sleeps in till 7:30 and my daughter 6:30. Most days neither of them are jump out of bed and start the day kids. My daughter wants to cuddle in bed, watch a couple cartoons and have her breakfast before she's ready for day clothes and her hair brushed. My son sometimes will lounge in bed nursing a thing of soy shake, before getting up. At any rate, it takes me a full hour to get everyone ready to get out of the house and have all their stuff in order. Apparently, I missed the notice on the monthly calendar saying he had to be there at 8AM today and was berated for him missing some sort of field trip, not that he or I cared especially, and then the pedagog in the room freaked out that he had pinworm, despite the fact he'd already been medicated for two days and had come to b√∏rnehave for several days before we'd figured out what the problem was. Then I get a text saying my daughter had also been expected an hour ago. Thankfully I could bike her to her destination and the group walks so slow that I actually beat them to the destination. It was cool seeing her other daycare buddies, but all in all a kind of crazy making morning for me.
