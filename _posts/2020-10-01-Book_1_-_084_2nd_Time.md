![84: 2nd Time](/comics/Book_1_-_084_2nd_Time.png)

I sent in my ballot for the US election, so I am officially not following the US news until January. Instead I've started trying to pay more attention to the Danish news, both an expat paper and the free public one online. I admit, most of the time I get distracted by articles about the coronavirus inconvenience. There was a cluster in Aarhus that was got under control and then a couple of weeks ago it just started popping up everywhere. Thankfully not so much in my county, but certainly in neighboring ones. Mostly 20 somethings and teenagers. They scaled public gatherings back down to a 50 person limit and started closing bars at 10 again. Our growth curb is dropping again, so seems to be working. The biggest scare for me was a kid at a friend's børnehave got infected, which means it must have been from her parents, because it's pretty hard for 4 year olds to get sick with COVID-19. It just made the whole thing feel very close. 25 people in our entire county and one was in my backyard. Thankfully, because of the resurgence they opened up a lot more testing centers and now the kids can be tested in Næsted instead of the next county over, so that makes a big difference. Here's hoping we all stay healthy this winter. Got to go get that flu vaccine...
