![32: Track Phone](/comics/Book_1_-_032_Track_Phone.png)

So I now have the rare honor of having visited the only two places in the world with complete collections of crocodile species: St. Augustine, FL and middle of nowhere, 30 minutes of walking through farmlands from the closest train station, on the Danish island of Falstar. How random is that? It was awesome though. I mean I got to pet a baby armadillo!
