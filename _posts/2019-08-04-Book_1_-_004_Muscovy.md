![4: Muscovy](/comics/Book_1_-_004_Muscovy.png)

Saturday I went to Køge beach with the kids, it's a big sprawling sand beach with shallow coastal waters, pretty typical for the island of Sjælland where we live and also typical, I ran into somebody we knew. Because of the way Danish towns are set up, I am much more prone to running into people I know here than in the 'states where people drive everywhere and there's rarely a proper down town. I'm also a lot more distinct looking here, though I stood out in New England too. Anyway, we were talking about future summer vacation plans, to travel or not to travel, and this acquaintance brought up the popular concept of not traveling outside the country because of the environmental impact of airplanes. I hate this. The trend of letting industry continue to pollute and putting an undue burden on individuals to stop the current runaway greenhouse gas criss makes me see red. I recycle, I buy conscientiously, I believe on being a good citizen of the world, but at the end of the day everything we do is a drop in the bucket compared to what governments can do to regulate industry and how much industry pollutes. Don't want to take a cruise ship, because they are ghastly for the environment, I'm with you, but the idea of not seeing the world because you have more of a responsibility for the environment than some ridiculous plant spewing toxins in the air so that offices can continue using disposable plastic cups...no. The brunt of environmental conservation and pollution reduction should start with industry first, not the little guys. Moreover, international travel is vitally important. Seeing other countries, how other people live, eat and enjoy life is how we broaden our horizons, it's how we gain empathy, tolerance and understanding of our fellow humans. Traveling to Guatemala is what will make someone more likely to say we shouldn't be separating and caging Central American children at the American boarder, just as traveling to Ukraine is what will make someone understand White is neither a culture nor a monolith.  Reduce your consumption, only eat organic, whatever makes you happy, but for goodness sake, PLEASE TRAVEL. Call your lawmaker up, make the legislative branch hold industry accountable instead of putting the burden on the little guys, that's the best way to help the environment and travel as far and as often as you can afford to. It will make you a better person and at least if the oil industry causes mass extinctions, you'll have had a chance to see some of the wonders of the natural world before they've all died off.
