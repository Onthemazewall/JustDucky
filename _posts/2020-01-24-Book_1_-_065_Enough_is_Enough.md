This is about a month late (like a lot of this comic, ha ha!), but here's the best shows I watched in 2019:

**Tuca & Bertie:**
A surreal adult animated show on Netflix, it ends up being a slice of life ballad of your 20's with weird bird people and all the oddness that one would assume would come with. It was funny, but also very poignant and a little dark.

**The Tick:**
A new take on the 90's alternative comic produced by Amazon. This was one of those shows where you wanted to watch the whole thing at once. The plot was fast paced, consecutive and interesting.  I had never seen The Tick before, but this pulled me right int.

**The Good Place:**

This show's famous enough I assume I don't need to describe it!

**Star vs. The Forces of Evil:**
Spanning four seasons, this Disney cartoon did so much growing. Gender balanced, pleasing art and an overreaching plot that just became better with time. If you're a cartoon fan, I definitely suggest investing the time in this one.

**Seven Deadly Sins**

We didn't watch a lot of anime in 2019 and there were shows that were good, but this was the best. Netflix paid a Japanese studio to do an anime of this rather popular manga and they knocked it out of the park. It had a lot of old sword and sorcery vibes and then went very different places!

**Russian Doll**
Another Netflix original with enough buzz that you probably don't need my take on it, aside from that it was amazing.

**Bonding**
Netflix really put out a lot of good stuff this year. If you don't like edgy works, stay clear, the premise of this is that a failing stand up comedian tries becoming a dominatrix. It's as funny and off color as you'd expect.

**After Life**
This was dark and sad and sometimes funny, but overall incredibly thoughtful and moving. It wasn't something that started out amazing, but it ended there. It's the story of a middle aged man getting over the death of his wife and learning to actually care about life again.

**Daybreak**
Netflix again. This one started out seeming like a typical zombie apocalyptic teenager show (goodness is that really a thing now?), but it went very interesting places. I suppose a theme for everything my husband and I liked this year. The narration was playful and creative, the characters surprisingly sympathetic and the plot twists awesome. I'm eagerly awaiting season two.
