![39: Next Plan](/comics/Book_1_-_039_Next_Plan.png)

So I've been dieting for the past few weeks and it's a very novel experience. I'm doing it mainly because I don't want to buy new clothes and my pattern of sleep deprivation, stay awake by eating too many cookies, drag myself through the day and repeat was not great for me. The sleep depriavation is still an issue and there are days that I just feel awful the whole time, but I don't think my diet makes much of an impact on that. I'm not doing anything drastic, just eating, say one cookie instead of five, and trying to cut most machine processed food out of my diet. This means I have to really think about what I eat. Instead of a box of granola for breakfast, I mix oats, raisins, coconut shavings and eat cold milk. Sugar free and tasty. For snacks instead of packs of cookies, I eat cut corn with melted butter, defrost fried tofu to eat with a little plum sauce, bananas, cheese chunks or nuts. Instead of homemade ice cream as dessert after dinner, I instead eat it midday and that's about it. The result is that I'm perpetually slightly hungry, but everything I eat tastes so much better. Especially cutting down on the sugar means the weekly batch of cookies I make for my husband, taste incredible (I also take a couple for myself). I'd like to switch to eating until I'm full when I've finished loosing my goal of 15 pounds, but I may keep the general food guidelines as they seem to be all upside.
