![12: Rooster Quest](/comics/Book_1_-_012_Rooster_Quest.png)

A couple housekeeping things:
1) I know there are still some kinks in the Mailchimp emails of the strips. I'm working on it.
2) My apologies to all chicken lovers for the sad representation of the rooster in this strip. I'm working on making better looking chickens, I promise!

In other news I just bought my two year old a bunch of Halloween themed clothes. She has enough clothes for 7 kids, but I didn't buy any of it for her and now that she actually has preferences, I feel I should honor them. I got her a black gauzy skirt with bats, a black shirt with a little witch in a cob webbed and bat infested landscape, an adorable bat/flying squirrel outfit with sparkly black pants, a bat face on the shirt and actual webbing under the arms and a charcoal gray dress with an electric salmon sequined jack-o-lantern. The last was the only one she didn't immediately love, but decided she liked. She calls it spooky and insists the other stuff isn't spooky. I guess I have to teach her the word 'scary' and I guess she aspires to be frightening. She does like to hide behind doors and jump out at me. Her crowning glory being when she hid in a closet, I went to hang a coat and she got a genuine shreak out of me. So I guess for the moment I'm raising a little goth kid.
