![70: Ducky Eugenics](/comics/Book_1_-_070_Ducky_Eugenics.png)

Last week is a blur for me. It was supposed to be a relaxing week for my son. Winter vacation for school, so the børnehaver were half empty, but unfortunately my child's tormenter was there. I watched history nearly repeat itself, with teachers insisting they could mediate the situation and if the children just sat down and talked it out, the bullying would stop. It didn't. It got worse. So in the end, for the last 6 weeks before school starts, I am dropping my child off at 7:30 in the morning and picking him up before noon, so he doesn't have to be on the playground with this other kid, which is where all the trouble happens. I am not happy about this solution, but there's just not enough time before school to switch børnehave and I am not letting my son be the guinea pig for trying to reform a bully. He understandably doesn't want to go at all, but hopefully with each consecutive day where nothing bad happens, he'll relax again.
