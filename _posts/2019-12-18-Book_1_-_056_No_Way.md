![56: No Way](/comics/Book_1_-_056_No_Way.png)

I suddenly get the appeal of meth. To be very upfront, I've never done drugs, even tried smoking, and do not intend to ever try drugs, but that said, I totally get the appeal now. I had the brief, lovely spat of a few months when my daughter slept through the night and I would wake up well rested, bursting with energy, creativity seeping from every pore. I started sewing projects, necklace projects, yard projects and biggest of all, this comic. Then she stopped sleeping through the night and I am back to the perpetual haze of sleep deprivation, some weeks getting tantalizingly close to refreshed, while others sunk so deep down I can't even process how tired I am anymore. They say that when you first take meth, before it starts destroying your body, it's like that, just amazing energy every day. On the bright side, eventually my daughter will sleep through the night. I'm guessing by May, when she turns 3, she'll finally be a good sleeper and I have no intention of stopping this grand project of a comic, albeit I realize my updating schedule has been deplorable. We're leaving for a trip to the US tomorrow, I'm packing my laptop and a pile of comics that just need to be processed on the computer as well as my drawing pad, so my hope is that after January 1st, I will be back to a dependable three day a week schedule, no promises before then! So have a great Chanukah, Yule, Kwanza, Christmas, Solstice, Squidmas or whatever you celebrate in the meantime!
