![75: Bad Sources](/comics/Book_1_-_075_Bad_Sources.png)

Sorry this is a bit of a dud to start with. The person on the other end of the phone is supposed to be the Author of Fresh Eggs Daily and Duck Eggs Daily. Anyway, I had to start back somewhere.

I realize there has been a ridiculous pause in the comic. Before the whole Coronavirus pandemic ramped up, I was in a state of extreme stress about my son, who's start to school was quickly careening towards disaster and I increasingly felt I had no tools to stop the bullying going on at his nursery school. A week before Denmark went into lockdown, I had just pulled him out of b√∏rnehave completely. Then Denmark went on lockdown, which was just miserable. It was supposed to be 18 days, but got extended another 14 and I thought I would go insane, but somewhere around day 16, it just became the new normal and we all found new patterns. So now I draw the comics in whatever few minutes I have between kid tasks and pretty much do all the computer work that way too. Inking still happens after the kids are asleep and most nights I actually have the energy for it.
