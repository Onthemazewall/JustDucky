I really should decide if I am going to commit to posting or just stop, but I can't bring myself to do the latter and the former seems to require headspace I don't have. Sigh.

Things are good in Denmark. Admittedly we have the mass mink murder to stop Cluster 5 from spreading around the world and  creating a second pandemic that will take a year to make a vaccine for...it's grim and I'm sorry for any industry to be ruined and jobs lost, but at the same time while I have no ethical problems with mink farming, morally I find it very off putting. Plus, I really really, don't want to take the chance of a our country being patient zero for a second pandemic. 

I've been doing a lot of socializing over bonfires. They are great for Denmark's for gray, dark months, where it's not actually very cold, but it isn't particularly pleasant and it's a COVID-19 safe activity. Danes like to roast bread on sticks here, which my kids love. I admit it's way better than marshmallows.

Things are starting to ramp up to Yule. I am getting into it a lot this year. Not just because my daughter is in pre-school and is getting excited from her classmates, but this year an entire month of celebrating that the darkest day is coming and will then go feels good. We've all got exciting advent calendars, we've getting a tree December first, I'm looking into cookies and all that. My daughter's Bedstemor is teaching her how to forage in the woods for Yule decorations, great pagan fun!
