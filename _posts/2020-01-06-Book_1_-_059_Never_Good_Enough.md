![59: Never Good Enough](/comics/Book_1_-_059_Never_Good_Enough.png)

Married to someone who programs for a living, I have become resigned to the fact that applications that I use are constantly changing and this is just the nature of the beast, no use kvetching about. However, today I opened Manga Studio, now called Clip Studio and they had altered the interface to such a degree that I couldn't even find my works in progress and after much fussing now realize there are like two extra steps I have to take just to get to my workspace. Then I go to post this strip and the program I use for that has inexplicably changed. Now to be fair, I'm sure this has to do with me rebooting my computer for the first time in months, but I am not a happy camper. Sometimes progress just makes you cranky.
