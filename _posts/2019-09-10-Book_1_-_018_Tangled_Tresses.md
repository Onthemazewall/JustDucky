![18: Tangled Tresses](/comics/Book_1_-_018_Tangled_Tresses.png)

Lucky you this week the comic is posting all five days! Next week,  my family is taking the ferry to Oslo, Norway, so I won't be able to post until Friday. I decided that the best way to deal with this was to post strips in advance of our adventure.

I'm really sorry the images still aren't showing up in the Mailchimp mailing list. I can't figure out why. You can always click on the Just Ducky banner, or remember the page is http://onthemazewall.com

About this comic, for whatever reason kids have always liked putting their hands in my children's hair. My son has always been very tolerant of it, though it makes me conscious of how bad I was at getting the knots out. My daughter on the other hand hates it. She sees it as a gesture of condescention by the older kids, which it sometimes is, and will screech "nej!" while covering her head. I've tried to encourage them to slap her 5 instead. There's one little Persian boy, Pasha, who has a real big brother vibe and is the sweetest child, she lets him pat her hair no problem, whereas Meron, an Eritrean kid at the nursery school just won't stop and seems genuinely hurt that my daughter runs from him. They're going to be classmates next year, so hopefully they will have worked that out by then.
