![7: Superior Model](/comics/Book_1_-_007_Superior_Model.png)

Sorry this one is a little weak, I was going to run it as a double, but then realized with the static site strip preparing tool that my husband made for me that's really hard and not worth the headache, so you get a rather weak strip today.

I suppose while I'm on the topic of apologies, I should say sorry to all the chicken lovers. I know there are lots of people, in my life and in general, who are very much into chicken keeping. Aside from my buddies out in the farmland near Præstø who butcher their birds (chicken meat is delicious and so versatile!), I don't get the appeal of chickens instead of ducks. I would be delighted to hear from anyone who would like to educate me on the awesomeness of chickens over ducks and break me of my bias.

In other news, I am tired of having to defend the fact that I socialize without my husband. I realize in the US couples get togethers are the norm, goodness knows I've seen enough shows with episodes about couples dates, couples friends and the importance of as a couple of having other couple buddies. In Denmark, yes, for the most part, when I make play dates for the kids, which comprises the backbone of my social life, both parents usually come, which I find refreshing and delightful, getting two parental co-workers/friends for the effort of one is fantastic and if one parent isn't feeling good, still allows the play date to happen. Especially cool is that unlike in the U.S. I tend to like both parents as opposed to in the U.S. where a lot of times I didn't really get along with my mommy co-workers' spouses. That said, I resent the pressure to drag my husband along on my social outings. I'm an extrovert, he's an introvert, I like having a sprawling network of acquaintances and friends, I'm restless if I'm home all day, my husband can spend the whole weekend never leaving the house and be perfectly content. I can count the number of friends he has on one hand. I don't see why I should make him do my thing. There's plenty of activities we like to do together: travel, board games, watching anime, fine dining, video games, etc. I don't see why we should do things together that one of us doesn't like.  So from now on, I'm not going through the lengthy list of polite and true explanations of why me and the kids showed up, but not my husband. This is how we operate and if someone doesn't want to associate with us, because it's socially too weird, that's their choice.
