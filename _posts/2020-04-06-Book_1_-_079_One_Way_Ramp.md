![79: One Way Ramp](/comics/Book_1_-_079_One_Way_Ramp.png)

So there should be an Epstein interlude strip, but the weirdness of living in a world with no future, just an endless present is doing weird things to my brain and I couldn't even begin to make one up...

In good news for a future hopefully coming, the prime minister should be announcing soon what the re-opening action plan for Denmark will be. I'm suspecting public transportation is going to be out of commission for a while, but I'm hoping to maybe be able to start checking out library books and perhaps they will do school in shifts...
