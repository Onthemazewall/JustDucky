![88: Back to Work](/comics/Book_1_-_088_Back_to_Work.png)

We got a pet hedgehog. His name is Samson Chestnut Robert esq. or Chestnut Bob for short. He's a purebred who came with papers tracing his lineage back 5 generations. He's also an adorable soft ball of prickles. He was pretty bristly the first couple of days, but now he lets us pick him up, take him to places to explore, pet him in all sorts of different ways and even touch his cute little feet and ears. The kids adore him. Saying good morning to Chestnut Bob has become part of our before school ritual. We were told hedgehogs are not children pets, but to me they are ideal, because they give so much feedback on how they are feeling. The kids are not allowed near his enclosure without Michael or myself, but they have learned by how he bristles, what he enjoys and doesn't. They are both very gentle and move slowly for him. It's much better than a hamster or guinea pig, which isn't good at expressing when it's scared or dislikes being pet.
