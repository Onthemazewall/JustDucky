Since moving to Denmark, since starting to listen to a lot of Native American podcasts, since researching the history of Israel I've thought a lot about nationhood and sovereignty. Obviously the idea of immigration and colonization has come up a lot on these podcasts. Sometimes intersecting in interesting or offensive ways (in the case of one episode of Medicine for the Resistance, where they framed the Jews as white colonizers and the Palestinians as victimized indigenous people), but regardless it's made me question what I believe a lot and this is my conclusion: I don't believe in ethno-states or any group has an indisputable claim to a piece of the earth. We are all immigrants, whether we can remember when we left our last location or it's simply genetic evidence of our roots. People from the Americas clearly came from Asia, People in Northern Africa are clearly an Arab-African blende, I'm pretty sure Northern Europeans are interbred with neanderthals, Greenlanders came from North America, the list goes on and on. The point being that what makes a country should be collective culture, a pact between people to uphold basic values and anyone who wants to share those core values should be welcomed to join. I also think that cultural drift is good over time. Cultural drift is how Scandinavia became the modern near utopia it is today. Cultural drift is why the United States is no longer a place where only white land owning men have power. Cultural drift is, hopefully, progress. This does not erase problematic issues like the legacy of the long ugly history in the Americas between the pre-colonial population and the post-colonial population. But I think it helps to think we are all here now and nobody is going anywhere. We need to all figure out how to make societies that are equitable and palatable to everyone. I realize the US has a massive white terrorist problem right now, that there are Islamist extremist terrorist groups in Israel, etc etc and these are groups that will not negotiate or see reason, but I think for every violent crazy out there, are five people who at their core can be persuaded and see reason, people who, if we take away this idea that certain groups have an inalienable right to a piece of land, can compromise and help build a future that is good for everyone.
