![35: They Can Fly](/comics/Book_1_-_035_They_Can_Fly.png)

One of my all time favorite cookie recipes. I'm sure I got it from some health magazine forever ago and it seemed too weird not to try. They're savory and sweet and just really unusual.

Fruity Tarragon Cookies

• 1/2 cup chopped dry apricots

• 2 Tbsps dried tarragon

• 1/2 cup sugar

• 1/2 cup butter

• 1 egg

• 1/3 cup olive oil

• 3/4 tsp sea salt

• 2 cups flour


Mix dry ingredients and then add all wet. Bake for 15 minutes at 350 F.
