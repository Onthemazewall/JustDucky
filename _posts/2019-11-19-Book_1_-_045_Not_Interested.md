Sorry this is a day late, but I have a great story to go with it.

I have this SUV bike, called a Winther Kangaroo cargo bike that I transport the kids in. Problem is, my husband isn't insanely athletic like me and gets leg cramps using it, which means with no car, the distances he can easily traverse are a third what I and so he can't really pick up our son from b√∏rnehave among other things. So we thought we'd convert the bike to an electric assist. Problem is, it was built in 2010 and they didn't start making the convertible models until 2014, so I've been scanning DBA, the Craig's List of Denmark for a newer bike. Converting a bike costs 14,000 crowns, buying a new Kangaroo Luxe with electric assist is 35,000 crowns and the going rate for one use is 25,000. So after months of looking, I was shocked to find one listed at only 16,000. I jumped at the chance.

This meant three days of total stress of being convinced someone was going to make the seller an above asking price offer and snatch the bike from my grasp. There were a lot of logistics involved. He wanted cash and it was the weekend and an ATM was not going to let me just take the equivalent of almost 3 American grand out on my debit card. The seller could only meet after work and the transport company said there'd be quite the surcharge for picking up during rush hour. My husband and I ran through a bunch of scenarios and we decided I'd go Monday with the kids and meet the man at 5PM at his place.

So, I take an hour train ride with kids ages 2 and 5 into central Copenhagen to walk down a darkened street to meet a man in the darkened alleyway of his home with more than some people make in a month tucked into a money belt that has shimmied its way under my bosoms. Did I mention something went wrong with my cellphone and the battery was extremely low? I had to do it old school, marking a map with the streets I wanted and then asking strangers at every crossing which way to my next street. Then it turned out I had the street number wrong, it was 96, not 17, not sure how that happened! So I'm sprinting with the giant stroller 5 blocks to the correct location.

I ate adrenaline for dinner that night. Anyway, I didn't get mugged. The guy turned out to be super nice and very affluent and he improved bikes as a hobby, hence why he was selling it so cheap. The pick up went smoothly, albeit, I had to chew out the company that showing up between 6-8 was not acceptable when I was waiting out in the dark and cold with my small children (though the seller pointed out there was a playground near his palatial home) and because I then sprinted all the way back, we even made it home by 8PM just as my husband was paying the driver. 

The bike, for the record, is amazing and I intend to use the electric assist to do even more insane biking feats and go longer distances. That is once my thighs
