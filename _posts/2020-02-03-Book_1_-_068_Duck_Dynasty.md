![68: Duck Dynasty](/comics/Book_1_-_068_Duck_Dynasty.png)

Yesterday the sun was shining brightly, the yard was festooned with snow drops, crocuses and erantis, even the hyacinth are starting to peek out of the ground. It was a beautiful day and I biked to the over priced indoor playscape and parked myself there for 7 hours...Usually I'm all for going with the weather, but my son had been sick on Thursday, didn't have the mental bandwidth to go to b√∏rnehave on Friday and then was an absolute terror on Saturday. I wasn't taking any chances on Sunday. He's now old enough I can tell him that I will be following his little sister and he can do whatever. About every half hour he would whizz by on his way to some new fun, so I knew he was OK. Towards the end I let his sister wander a bit too. As long as she knew where I was she could come running to let me know of whatever latest injustice had been delivered upon her person, such as an errant bouncy ball or another kid taking her spot. I was especially impressed that other kids would come to tell me why she was crying. The highlight for my son was finding some "teenagers" i.e. tweens on smart phones who spoke English as well as Danish. He thought this was amazing and quickly wanted me to hand him his iPad, so he could show them Owl House, which has not come to Denmark yet. My daughter said that the playscape was fun, but she prefers going to nanny group every day. I guess she really likes it there! In fact, I almost kept her home today, because she'd been feverish at night and is still very congested and they have a new kid starting, who is only 10 months old, but she insisted she needed to go and the nanny said she was allowed. I realize I'm drifting off topic, but culturally it is still hard for me to imagine starting my child in daycare, no matter how bespoke, at just ten months!
