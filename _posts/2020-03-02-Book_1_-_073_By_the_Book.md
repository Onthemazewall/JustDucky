![73: By the Book](/comics/Book_1_-_073_By_the_Book.png)

So I took up Judo recently. Originally I just wanted to visit the dojo to see if maybe they'd let me run a kendo club under their umbrella, however the judo sensei was out of the country for the month and by the time I got there, I'd found other ways to to make the kendo club work. However, I also just really wanted to try Judo, after all I watched countless Fashionable Judo Girl Yawara episodes in my late teens. It turned out to be exactly as fun as the anime made it out to be and I promptly ordered a cheap karate outfit, so as not to ruin my good kendo keikogis. The second class is tomorrow night. It's just me and an extremely skilled teenage girl plus the teacher. She's been doing Judo for 2/3rds of her life! It trains at the same time as Jujitsu, which is a much bigger group. I don't really understand the appeal of doing Brazilian Jujitsu instead of Japanese Judo. I admit I'm prejudice because BJJ has a reputation for a high injury rate and personally I just don't like joint locks that much. I get out my aggressive spirit with kendo, I prefer "the gentle way" for wrestling.

What's very exciting is all my martial arts training from college still holds water, so we could skip over the most basic of basics like how to fall properly and even basic throws. We got  to move right into practicing leg sweeps and hip throws, which was great. My floor pinning is total newb level, which is just fine. It's exciting to have so much to learn, but a good base to build on. As my husband says, some women go to the spa, his wife likes to go beat people up!
