![24: Poor Word Choice](/comics/Book_1_-_024_Poor_Word_Choice.png)

I put a lot of thought into this strip. For the record, my younger sister really did have a roommate in college who brought her chocolates and whom we called Chocolate Boy and whom we later found out was black. My older sister was horrified, though to be honest I lack enough understanding of racism in the country I grew up with to understand why it was so bad, aside from understanding that 'boy' being used as an appellation for men used to be a way of emasculating and belittling them. So it didn't really work as a  punchline if I didn't get it. So I started thinking of all the less than PC things she, and for that matter me, called other people in our circle. For the record, while we did call a friend's boyfriend "Dutch Geezer", it was only because she was calling him "Dutch Boy" and freaking out that he was 6 years her junior. We pointed out that in 50 years they'd both be old geezers anyway, thus "Dutch Geezer". I am happy to say that conversation was over a decade ago, they have since married and had a couple of trilingual twins who thought I had the best wedding ever, because the reception started with cutting the cake. Do I know what introverts and little kids want, or what?
