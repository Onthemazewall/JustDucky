![21: No More Bugs](/comics/Book_1_-_021_No_More_Bugs.png)

So we leave for Norway on Sunday. Everyone keeps telling me that vegetables are insanely expensive there, so we're stocking up on the ones the kids like before heading out. We're packing light, but which I mean I'm sharing a backpack-suitcase with the kids and my husband is taking his own. Being bigger means your clothes take up a lot more space. You'd think the kids' would take up very little, but the fact that they can go through 2-3 outfits a day, means I need to pack a larger volume of clothes for them than myself. The kids' bedstemor is going to take care of the ducks, i.e. give them fresh water and refill their water bowl a couple times. I'm kind of sad to leave them right now, because all three have started laying. Spare lays blue eggs, Strike white eggs, but Candle Pin has been an adventure of weird eggs. We've had two rubber eggs (no shell, just membrane), a fairy egg (tiny) and now two jumbo ones. Yesterday's had two yolks, I haven't checked today's yet.
