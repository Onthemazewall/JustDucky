![62: Contingency Plans](/comics/Book_1_-_062_Contingency_Plans.png)

The spring ephemerals are all starting to poke out of the ground. Erantis are budding and I have lawn daisies blooming already. Global warming are strange times to live in. It's rained so much this winter that my yard, which is slopped, is a network of tiny runoff streams. Today it's 50 degrees ferenheit out, admittedly also steel gray skys, but truly these are strange times. I wonder what kind of spring and summer we will have this year...
