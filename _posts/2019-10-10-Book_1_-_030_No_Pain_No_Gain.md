![30: No Pain No Gain](/comics/Book_1_-_030_No_Pain_No_Gain.png)

Just to be clear, I have infinite respect for anyone who goes through the trauma of having a mastectomy and for those who do it for non-life threatening reasons....my hats off to you, you are braver than I! 

So a new year begins. Yesterday was a hard Yom Kippor, I had a lot of things to work through, but it's good to be starting the new year on a totally clean slate. I ended up casting an entire loaf of bread upon the estuary by the house. 

I've come to the realization that just as every little farm compound is surrounded by a barrier of trees, so the entire city of NÃ¦stved is fringed in forest. You can't go that far in any direction out of the city without hitting a boarder of woods. It's really nice. It's not the deep rambling woods of my childhood in Maine, but I'll take what I can get.
