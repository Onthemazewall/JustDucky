![6: Eggspectations](/comics/Book_1_-_006_Eggspectations.png)

Seriously guys, turkey eggs are gross, really gamey, don't try them.

In other news, last night my husband and I discovered the show Chambers on Netflix. It's a suspense horror series about a girl who gets a heart transplant and then the family of the dead heart doner gets uncomfortably close to them. So far, so good, and to be honest what makes it particularly intriguing is the setting. This is the first show I have ever seen that takes place in the American South West. I don't know how much TV I've seen, but seriously I've never seen anything take place in desertous, rural, Arizona. I had no idea we had sandstorm problems in the U.S.! Second and even more interesting, the protagonist, her guardian and her boyfriend are all First Nations. It isn't explicitly called out, but the opening scene includes the girl berating her uncle for drinking soda on a weekday and then a feather and a dreamcatcher on the truck made us wonder, so I looked it up and the actors are Apache, Cree and I can't remember the third ethnicity, but all most deliberately cast with Native American actors.
