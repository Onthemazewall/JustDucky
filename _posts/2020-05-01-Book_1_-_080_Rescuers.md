![80: Rescuers](/comics/Book_1_-_080_Rescuers.png)

I'm back. I've promised myself that I'm going to finish out the first arc, which isn't really that many more strips and then see if I have the energy/creativity to do a part 2 in Denmark or what.

The worst of the lockdown is over here. Day institutions for children up to about age 12 have been open here for a bit over two weeks and that one thing has made life so much more manageable. The days are no longer a stressful blur of trying to keep the kids occupied and thinking of what remote place I can bike to. My son has now started preschool while my daughter had two more weeks of nanny group and just started nursery school today. I've now had a lesson driving a manual transmission car and life feels like it has a future again. 

Now if the clubs could open back up, I'd be really happy, but things are sustainable and I have plenty to think of trying to navigate all these new places my children are going to and memorizing names and faces of their new classmates!
