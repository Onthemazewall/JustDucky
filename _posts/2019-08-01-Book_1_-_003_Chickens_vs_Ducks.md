Blackberry season has come. I love blackberry season. In Maine, it didn't hit till the very tail end of August. We'd wade into the 5 foot high brambles and retrieve those sweet treats while trying to get scratched up as little as possible. I like blackberry picking better than raspberry picking, because raspberry canes tend to have fuzzy little thorns that break off and fester under your skin.  Also an hour of picking yields you a pies worth of berries, whereas it takes 3 times that for raspberries, which is unfortunate, because I like the taste of raspberries a lot better. The big blackberry barbs do more initial damage, but it feels cleaner. In Næstved, raspberries don't grow wild like on North Haven, but there are blackberry brambles everywhere. They grow more than ten feet high and with all the sun, they're ready a good month earlier than Maine. Næstved is a city of 40,000 and we have some wooded chunks, but it still amazing me how pervasive and ubiquitous blackberry patches are. Yesterday I started by harvesting berries in the abandoned yard on the street and then worked my way up the working harbor into the woods walk behind the low income housing. Only about 10 percent were ripe and I couldn't reach a lot, because of the masssive height of the vines, but I still had a good haul. My daughter had berries and biscuits for dinner last night and since my husband complains that they have too many pips, that what I'm serving, with the addition of whipped cream, for lunch to my guests today!
