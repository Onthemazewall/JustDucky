![83: Fast](/comics/Book_1_-_083_Fast.png)

So, three weeks before the pandemic hit Denmark I started a kendo club. Then we were locked down from March 15th to April 15th and the opening up of Danmark slowly unfolded. Since May, has the club actually been meeting again and in August, we got dojo space and moved indoors (with masks on, which was not normal here, but I'm not a chance taker). Now we are 10 people strong and have been invited to join the national kendo federation. I could not be happier or prouder. It has been a lot of hard work and worth every moment of it. Most importantly, I have somewhere to play kendo and people to play it with. Part 1 of my 5 year plan is in good standing and since I just got my motorboat license, part 2 is coming along. Now I need to start working on pottery again...
