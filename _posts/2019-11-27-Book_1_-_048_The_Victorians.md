![48: The Victorians](/comics/Book_1_-_048_The_Victorians.png)

I actually had a webcomic artist block me on Twitter, because I pointed out that her delight with some crazy West Coast couple who was living their life like they were in the Victorian age wasn't cute. Aside from the whole horrendous medical care bit, the Victorian era was a cruel time of haves and have nots, of institutionalized racism, bigotry and intolerance. Also...corsets!

That said, I would have loved to see 19th century North America, to see a flock of passenger pigeons so dense they blocked out the sun, to experience all tha wilderness and beauty. To see the Turtle Island that all the indigenous people worshipped, before the mass genocide pushed them into completely unwanted sections of land and erased them from Americans consciousness....tomorrow is Thanksgiving, isn't it? Sorry to be a downer right before one of my favorite American holidays, because problematic origin aside, I still think it's beautiful to have a time to get together with family and despite all th ugliness that came next, the initial gesture of helping your fellow humans survive the winter is a true mitzvah. Plus, pie. I love pie. So for those of you in the 'states, please eat some pie for me!
