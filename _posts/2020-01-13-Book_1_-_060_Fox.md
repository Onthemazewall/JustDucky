We went to The Blue Planet with a friend today. I'd been wanting to go for a while, but it's a headache via public transportation, so having an offer of a ride was a real treat. She has four children of her own, the eldest was in school today, so it was a tight squeeze with three carseats, two boosters and me packed in the middle of the car, but we did it. Thankfully being a Monday the marine life museum was fairly empty. The exhibits were beautiful. It maybe wasn't as amazing as its Boston counterpart, but it was very fine museum. The trip was also pure chaos, between our two rambunctous five year olds, the baby and two two year olds, especially since while my daughter was happy to just follow the big boys anywhere, the other toddler meandered to the beat of his own drum, slowly and unpredicatably. Since my friend was hampered by her newborn, I did most of the kid training and often resorted to grabbing the little boy and hauling him after the other three children so that we could keep together.

The past several months have been very even keeled for my son, to the point that I wondered if he was "outgrowing" his presumed autistic behaviors. Well that illusion was broken this day. There was a play space with mats and lots of soft blocks. Our party all removed their shoes before playing there, but there were a lot of school groups that did not. My son lost it, it was such an blatant violation of the unspoken rule that you don't wear your shoes on matted playspaces that he couldn't deal. He tried telling the kids, but they ignored him. He tried telling their teachers, but they ignored him. It was excrutiating. Noise, chaos and rule breakers, we had no choice but to just go to another section of the museum. As my son became increasingly overstiumulated, he became increasingly quirky and particular. When I had to change his underpants and had packed the wrong kind, his screams were so loud my friend could hear him...at the other end of the museum.

So now we're home relaxing. Brief episodes of stress aside, everyone had a really good time and it was a very special experience.
