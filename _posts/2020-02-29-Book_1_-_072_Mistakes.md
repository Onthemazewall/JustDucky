![72: Mistakes](/comics/Book_1_-_072_Mistakes.png)

This week was so long that by the time shabbat hit, I couldn't even remember what Monday was like...oh yeah, child wailing all night over the weekend over a ear infection with no fever, Monday taking him to the doctor and getting cipro drops. Tuesday a normal day that I blearily dragged myself through and made a foolish posting mistake with the comic. Wednesday we went to the Experimentorium with a friend, we drove into Copenhagen and it was so awesome one 1/4th of the place could have kept the kids occupied all day, needless to say it was overwhelming and they didn't want to leave. Thursday we had to take the bus to Slagelse. Despite Denmark having amazing non-car infrastructure the place they fall down is hospitals. Someone had this "brilliant" idea that it would be a great cost savings measure to have Slagelse and Næstved specialize instead of two fully staffed hospital. And yeah, IF you have a car they are only 30 minutes a part. However, if you DON'T own a car, it ends up being two hours between walking to the bus or train station and then walking to the hospital and leaving in a little padding in case something goes wrong. So I had to take my son to my daughter's orthopedic appointment and we made a whole day of it. Admittedly it was a pretty great day. The waiting room was incredibly fun, they even had volunteers to play with the kids (I intentionally showed up 30 minutes early, because I knew the kids wouldn't be grumpy if they didn't get time to play). We stopped by my son's old børnehave, we had an amazing hamburger lunch at Andrew's and then played at the library for several hours. Friday, I was exhausted because my daughter had been up in the night with a stuffy nose and so I just walked downtown doing errands and then there was a nanny group graduation party for one of my daughter's mates. A very long week. Admittedly this morning, I woke up refreshed and to find that the ducks have started laying again. Despite the endless cold, gray weather, I guess this means spring has officially come! And so I decided to post a comic strip, because this is definitely something that counts as relaxation and not work these days.
