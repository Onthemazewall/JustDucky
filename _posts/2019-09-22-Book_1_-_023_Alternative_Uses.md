![23: Alternative Uses](/comics/Book_1_-_023_Alternative_Uses.png)

We used to live on a fairly busy road. It was a cut through between the main street of town and High street, which used to be the main street through town. Thankfully soon before we bought the place a local law was passed forbidding trucks and other commercial traffic from using it, so it was neither too loud nor too dangerous when we lived there. Plus our house was set back fairly far on our acre of land. 

Anyway, what was great about the street was that you could put simply anything out at the end of the driveway and someone one would take it. We got rid of all sorts of stuff that way, from old furniture to scrap left by the previous owners. It was much easier than taking stuff to the sometimes open recycle center and I felt good knowing it would get a new home. This was the eventual fate of the chicken coop our neighbor gave us, but not before my son and his friends
