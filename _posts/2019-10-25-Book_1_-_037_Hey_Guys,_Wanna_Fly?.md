![37: Hey Guys, Wanna Fly?](/comics/Book_1_-_037_Hey_Guys,_Wanna_Fly?.png)

I had so much fun with these strips. I shouldn't be surprised that it took me like 35 strips to get to the meat of the story, but I'm glad I'm there now. The moral of this story, is don't get Call ducks unless you plan to clip their wings and if you want happy Call ducks, you better have a pond! And for anyone who thinks I'm being harsh with the Call ducks' frat boy personality, oh just you wait, the little one who can't fly is a main character for the entire first half of the comic (this is going to be split into two parts: U.S. and Denmark) and I promise you-ack! Two year old is bouncing on my arm. Well, whatever, you'll see!
