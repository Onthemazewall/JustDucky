![85: Being in Your 30s](/comics/Book_1_-_085_Being_in_Your_30s.png)

I think I redid this strip 3 or 4 times. It was the hardest to create. That night and the ensuing few months were some of the most scary of my life. I've had periods of time where I've been more unhappy and it was an imminent threat like a car speeding for you, but there was just this sense of ancestral dread, of this is what countless generations of Jews before had experienced and that we were at a cross roads and we new which road to take, but yet making it happen was so hard and scary. When I was a little girl, I used to lie on my bed a fantasize about if my family had to escape suddenly, what would I take with me? What would I leave? Even at age 7 I was pretty certain I should take whatever real jewelry I owned and try and get the pets to come along and just leave everything else behind. Nothing mattered as long as my whole family got out safely. Unlike the fantasy, we had the privilege of being able to get out with all our possessions and we actually shipped a 20' container of personal possessions all the way to Denmark! Mike's new company paid half, so it was about 5 grand and some of the best use of money I can ever think of. Four years ago, people laughed at us for being "Trump Refugees", now no one mocks us, but I can't say there's any pleasure in having our decision being vindicated.
