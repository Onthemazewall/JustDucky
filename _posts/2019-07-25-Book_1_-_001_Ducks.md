![1: Ducks](/comics/Book_1_-_001_Ducks.png)

Hurray! After a long epically sleep deprived hiatus from webcomicking I am back. I had a lot of trouble finding inspiration, but finally hit on ducks as the right lens to write about my life again. You might notice the very simplistic website, this is because I decided I couldn't afford $15 on a hobby website right now, so instead my husband has helped me make a static site on Github. It would be impossible for me to do without him and even with all his assistance, this is a lot more complicated than a regular commercial paid website. That said, it's free, it does what I want and I'm happy with it, so my apologies in advance if there are any technical hiccups.
