I loved working on this strip. The idea of being so out of touch that you call up to tell your sibling you got married and expect to be showered in gifts tickles me. I don't remember talking that much about marriage when I was a kid. My older sister always said she had no intention of getting married. I wanted a barn wedding and my younger sister had always said she was didn't want a wedding, but was going to elope and have an elopement party so that she still got all the presents. For the record, I got married in a Free Mason's Hall not a barn, but we didn't have place settings, we cut the cake first thing at the reception and we achieved the joyous, laid back atmosphere that I wanted it. I was like the opposite of a bridezilla. In fact, several people in the wedding party complained that I didn't have a color theme or do any sort of required dress. My theory was that with so many different body types and colorings it was just easier if everyone chose their own outfit, but I guess it was hard for them to then decide what to wear. On the plus side, I had someone who gained too much weight to fit in her intended dress and the fact that nobody matched to begin with made this a nonissue. Did I mention we had 12 people in the wedding party? Originally we were just going to have the friend who introduced as the Best Maid of Honor, but one of my sisters was concerned about the optics and asked my mom to have me put them in the party. At that point, we decided my husband's sister and niece also then had to be up there and if we're up to five, might as well invite all the people who had been influential in our courtship as well as our closest and oldest friends. It was just huge and wonderful. I maintain that weddings aren't about the bride and groom, but about the community and their approval of your match. That's why I left almost all the planning up to my mother and I was very happy with the results. Surrounded by friends and family, everyone having fun, a great way to usher in a marriage.
