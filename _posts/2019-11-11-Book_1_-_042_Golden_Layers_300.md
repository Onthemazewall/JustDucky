![42: Golden Layers 300](/comics/Book_1_-_042_Golden_Layers_300.png)

I really miss my Golden Layers right now. My ladies haven't laid a single egg since the fox attack. I wonder how long it will take the trauma to wear off. Spare seems entirely healed and 2 weeks seems like an eternity to me, but I suppose for a life altering traumatic event that's a drop in the bucket.

In other news, Thursday I take the Danish 1 exam. I have to get up at 5:30, take Beatrix to Bonus Bedstemor's house, bike Walter to his friend Dotan's house by 6 AM with his booster seat, so I can lock up my bike and make a 6:30 train to Roskilde, so I can walk 30 minutes to the testing place where they want me to be by 8:30. I figure I'd be crazy not to leave myself a little extra time for the train being late or other things going bump. I'll definitely be in "optimal" condition for the test. Then I have to walk back to the train, pick up my son, pick up my daughter and, yeah, we'll have some frozen soup and garlic bread for dinner. I really wish there was a testing facility nearer by. The company administrating it even has an office in town, but they don't do the tests here. This is particularly crazy for the oral exam, scheduled a month later where I will have to jump through similar hoops for a five minute exam. I've already told them if they want me there before 10 AM, I'm dragging the kids with me, because asking people to get up pre-dawn is the sort of favor you can't ask for twice in quick succession. Thankfully there's only three tests and they are every six months. Wish me luck!
