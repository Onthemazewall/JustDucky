![76: Success](/comics/Book_1_-_076_Success.png)

My son was sobbing yesterday, because his little sister asked him to do something he didn't want to do. I asked if she was his mom "no", was she is dad "no", then you don't have to do what she says. Later that day the kids wanted to stay in the yard and I desperately wanted to go for a walk. I loaded their iPads into the bike trailer we use as a double stroller and told them it was not a decision they got to make, because I am the mommy and there are times they need to do what I say. This did not stop my son from complaining, but they both calmed down after about 5 minutes. We walked for a good hour and a half. We walked by what will be my son's school, poked in windows, tried out the playground, meandered around the neighborhood. It's that weird time of year where the sun is hot, but the air is cold, so I ended up wearing gloves, a down vest and barefoot in sandals. The kids got out for a bit on the playground and were equally confused by what amount of clothing they really wanted to wear. Hopefully next week it will warm up enough that we can all be in T-Shirts.
