Posting early for Rosh Hashanah. May everyone have a sweet new year!

Yesterday we had my son's pre-birthday party. I originally wanted to plan a huge party again with 10-13 kids plus parents and siblings, but Walter said absolutely not, for his fifth birthday celebration he wanted two kids. When I pointed out he had five good friends, he agreed to two small birthday parties. Yesterday was the first. I made two parve cakes (by coincidence those are my best recipes), one for adults with jam and buttercream frosting and one glazed with lemon sugar and piled high with candy decorations.  This year we only sang the Danish happy birthday song. And The Itsy Bitsy Spider in Danish...because one of his friend's dad's was teasing him about what song they should be singing and suggested it and Walter insisted that yes, this was the song he wanted. In Danish the spider is named Peter and there are multiple verses. This is one of the things I've learned here, American songs end up becoming longer and much more melodic in Danish!

The guests were all boys, his Danish-Guatemalan friend, his Danish/English-Phillipino by way of Sweden friend and his mostly Danish-quarter English friend with his little brother, who is my daughter's buddy. For party favors I gave them modeling clay. 

It was still loud and busy and there was always something I needed to do, but on a much more controlled level. Not only did my son end the day much happier, those of his friends that were introverts were also much calmer after the event. I got to talk to everyone and it was just lovely. 

He also got amazing presents. I tried to do it English style, stacking the on a table to open for an audience later, but this is his third birthday in Denmark. He ripped each one open immediately as soon as the guest came in the door and handed them to him. One friend got him his first remote control car, which was so exciting  the other boys were chasing him down the hall for the remote and I had to stow it in the closet for the party. Another friend got him pouches full of coins, something every small child needs and loves. And the third got him a personalized apron and chief's hat and a pile of cooking supplies, everything he needs to make all his favorite recipes...baking powder and measuring spoons, a rolling pin, cupcake papers and candy eyes, hand painted spice containers and cookie cutters. Is he a lucky little guy or what?
