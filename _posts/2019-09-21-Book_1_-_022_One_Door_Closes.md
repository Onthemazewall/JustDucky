![22: One Door Closes](/comics/Book_1_-_022_One_Door_Closes.png)

I have a certain subset of acquaintances who like to talk about Israel with me. My husband doesn't get this, since we're not zionists, but the point still stands that if the entire world went mad it is theoretically the country that would always welcome us and if it's neighbors bombed it into oblivion, I think that would be the disappearance of about a 3rd of the worlds Jews, so yeah, I get caring about it more than, say, obsessing over Somalia. That said, I try not get too much into the weeds aside from the fact that I think the treatment of the Palestinians is horrible and if Israel isn't interested in a 2 state solution anymore, then they need to figure out how to treat their Palestinian citizens just like all the other ones. Somehow these conversations always dovetail into the idea of an ethnostate, whether its people claiming the poor indigenous Palestinians are being persecuted by the settler white Jews, or that the poor Jews are trying to defend their rightful home that they were kicked out of 2,000 years ago. As far as I'm concerned, they're both indigenous, they've both suffered great wrongs and taking sides just makes things worse (with the exception of groups that actually believe in the annihilation of the other side...)

Anyway, the point is, I don't believe in ethnostates. Look at the horrific founding of Pakistan. Look at how much trying to make India Hindu has hurt people there. And don't get me started on the trying to make America White issues...The reality is that humans have always migrated and been diverse. Simply by settling in a place for long enough, you'll start to get language drift and minute cultural changes. China has over 50 documented minorities. Even Japan that prides itself of its homogeneity has the Ainu as well as regional dialects and customs. What should make a country is a collective agreement to follow certain mores, not you're genetics. Denmark is a great example of that, where I've met the entire Norse pantheon in children's names, kids who are half African, Asian, Middle Eastern and every subcategory you can think of. This is why there is the term New Dane, for people who aren't indigenous to Scandinavia, but have become a part of the country, the culture. Denmark puts a lot of money and effort into assimilation, so that while it is multi-ethnic, it is not multicultural.

Visiting Oslo, Norway was an interesting contrast to this. Half the population is foreign and it felt, segmented in a way that Copenhagen is not. The most noticeable of this was the gypsies. Yes, I am aware that this is a derogatory term, but if you go around propagating the worst stereotypes about your culture, then I feel like you deserve to get to be referred to by a negative name. They remind me of every negative stereotype I've heard about Jews ramped up to 11.  In Denmark, there are anti-busking laws and they are trying to phase cash out entirely, so you really don't see Romeney. In Oslo, they were extremely aggressive. The first time it was my fault, because I wanted to know where they were getting their gorgeous skirts, but the second time we were just sitting on a park bench trying to enjoy our lunch. A woman would not leave us alone, even when we told her we didn't have cash and that since she was living in a welfare state, she shouldn't need our help. She then started asking for food and I gave her a bag of brunost that I had. She went away, though I doubt she actually ate the cheese. 

My husband looked it up, they are there illegally, so they aren't part of the welfare state. They used to camp in town, but laws were finally passed saying setting up settlements in public parks wasn't allowed. So presumably they live in the woods outside of Oslo and come in to beg. I do not understand this at all. According to Wikipedia, India has acknowledged them as having originated from India over a thousand years ago and will accept them back. They look like they're from India, though the ones I talked to said they considered themselves Romanian. Apparently grocery stores are starting to refuse to let them use the bottle return machines in an effort to convince them to move on. 

To me the whole thing seems the total antithesis of a country being a collection of people with shared values. It is the ultimate mini ethnostate, where the inhabitants of their collective refuse to interact with outsiders in any meaningful way, contribute nothing to the country they are operating inside and yet ask that society to provide their livelihood. If anyone can tell me why Romeney culture is worthy of respect as opposed to the only example I have ever seen of a people who perhaps deserve forced integration or to be forced to go back to their country of origin, I would welcome it whole heartedly.
