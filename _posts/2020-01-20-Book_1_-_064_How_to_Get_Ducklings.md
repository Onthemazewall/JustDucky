![64: How to Get Ducklings](/comics/Book_1_-_064_How_to_Get_Ducklings.png)

My son tried Taekwondo on Saturday. The teachers were nice, the kids enthusiastic and he loved it. I hated it. I didn't like that the teachers just watched while the kids did drills. I didn't like how much kicking there was. I didn't like that it mainly seemed useless. I realize this is a class for 5-9 year olds who, naturally, have little control over their bodies. However, I also know almost every truly great kendoka in the world started when they were 6. Just because they aren't good at it, to me is no excuse not to teach something real. Now admittedly, in my experience from the US, 80% of purported martial arts aren't real, even for adults. I have no idea what the percentage is in Denmark. At any rate, I realize now is the time for me to start a kendojo, because if I keep letting him do this banal imaginary ninja training, he might not want to switch in a couple years and I might go crazy being forced to sit and watch the class. So hopefully tomorrow I am going to visit what I suspect is the most authentic dojo in town. A guy who did plumbing on our house seemed like the real deal and his systema club is under their umbrella. I'm going to try Judo, because it meets at the right time and if that's also proper martial arts, I am hoping to ask them if they will let me use their space and start a family kendojo under their umbrella. I figure I can make it for all ages, with caveat that the smaller the child, the more likely their parent will be asked to participate as their partner. I don't know if my daughter can tag along or I'll have to figure something else out for her, but I feel like it's now or never if I'm going to make kendo a part of my life again!
