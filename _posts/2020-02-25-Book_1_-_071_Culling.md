![71: Culling](/comics/Book_1_-_071_Culling.png)

Thank you for sticking with me even with my insanely unpredictable posting schedule. I can see the light at the end of the exhaustion tunnel, I have days where I get enough sleep and wake up bursting with energy and then my son gets an ear infection and is up all night hollering...

In other news, the kendo club is barreling ahead. We had our practice class last week, which was very educational for me and hopefully fun for everyone who participated. I was shocked that this party dress wearing, prim, well behaved little girl turned out to be the most enthusiastic player. I guess when you're good at doing what your mama tells you having a chance to let loose, scream as loud as you can run around and hit things, you don't hold back. I am excited to be getting back to martial arts, I rearranged my closet for all my gear and I'm checking out a judo class tonight. It's like the Rubik's cube has been reset and there's all these really important things I want to make happen in my life: martial arts, sailing, clay sculpture...and one by one I have to figure out how to make them happen.
