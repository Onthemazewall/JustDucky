![55: Peas in a Pod](/comics/Book_1_-_055_Peas_in_a_Pod.png)

There was a beautiful full moon low in the sky this morning as I was biking the kids to their various destinations. I never thought much about the moon, sun and starts as a kid. They were there, they were pretty. It's not until just the last year when my son became obsessed with astronomy and I found myself studying our solar system in depth and everything we know about outer space that it really clicked that "stars" are all other suns and planets. The truth that we're on this spinning sphere in infinite blackness just didn't click till now or how the night sky is essentially the curtain being pulled back and letting us see the cosmos. Quite frankly I find it a bit terrifying, like I know I'm not going to fall off the earth, but suddenly seeing the big moon low in the sky feels like when you stand on the top balcony and look at a city down below, this feeling of being tiny and helpless. Happily I have decades of appreciation of sunsets and watching phases of the moon to fall back on instead of thinking of how infinitesimally small I am.
