![51: Never Gets Old](/comics/Book_1_-_051_Never_Gets_Old.png)

Sadly, while our Golden Layer 300s laid eggs year round, our Runners and Cayuga/Swedish Blue cross on hiatus until we have more than 6 hours of sunlight a day and presumably until we can actually see the sun again!

I was really stressing out about my house projects, especially since I had originally intended to give myself a day off, but reality set in and I realized that instead of 5 days to work on my backlog of obligations, it ends up being more like 3, because there are inevitably things that drag me away, be it kids not having 'school' or appointments and tests. So there went my day of rest. However, I realized I should think of it simply in terms of what I wanted to get done before we go for our two week trip to the 'states and that has made me much more relaxed. 

My biggest project, cutting the deadwood out of our six foot arborvitae hedge, trimming it, disposing of the leaves and burning the wood, is coming along nicely. I've almost finished the long run and just have the shorter side to do (we live on a corner). I feel pretty good about that. I've also got the pear tree pruned and cut all the straight shoots off our gnarly "troll" hazel. The indoor projects seem to be never ending, but I take that as a sign of progress that things I'd forgotten about for months pop to the forefront as I take care of other more pressing tasks.

I'm getting really into the weekly cookie making, especially as I realized the kids much prefer traditional Jewish cookies, because they aren't as sweet. I have a Holocaust Survivor's Cookbook that I've been mining for recipes. Eventually I'd like to get a Jewish cookbook that doesn't reference genocide, but how better to show that we still live than to cook the food of the people our enemies failed to kill?
