![8: Time Marches On](/comics/Book_1_-_008_Time_Marches_On.png)

I'd like to draw attention to my amazing editor, Julia Lord Parmalee, she is the inspiration for the character of Mere (there was something particularly funny about her correcting the speech patterns of her character). When I created Seeking Shelter Tristan Cowan (inspiration for the character of Sam) was my editor, he did an amazing job in the way you'd expect an engineer to be detail oriented and into specifics. I wouldn't say that I under appreciated him, but, wow, was he sorely missed when I started Infinite Trouble. He'd just finished a degree in mechanical and electrical engineering, moved and started a new job, so I felt like it was an undue burden on him. I asked several times at later dates if he'd be interested in editing the comic, but he'd done a thousand strips as a favor to a friend and that's a pretty big favor, he was done.  I could really tell the difference in the quality of the comics, all outside factors aside.

 Anyway, so before I started just Ducky, I made sure to line up a copy editor again. Julia is a braille transcriber by day, another job that requires attention to detail and specificity and she has been every bit as amazing as Tristan was. She never misses a typo, a grammatical glitch or other contextual confusion, like when I put the duck and the chicken on the wrong sides of their comparison list. She makes me really re-examine my work. And if you're thinking that's easy, it is not. I tried having a random copy editor, another comic artist for a while. He was very prompt on turnaround and just didn't catch any of the obvious errors, let alone the more obscure ones, and instead it was conversations about how, no, I didn't forget to shade that guy's palms with 50% gray, no one has pigment on their palms, so they are all pink regardless of where on the color spectrum your skin tone lies.

Now here's the bad news, Julia is on hiatus from editing my strips until the first of September. Why? Because she's experienced one of those two life events that we all know is coming and eternally hope will be later rather than sooner and to be fair it did happen 82 years after the catalyst that set this inevitable end in motion, but she'd rather hoped it would have been more like 100, like with her dad's other relatives. In short, one of my dearest friends, one of my sisters of the heart, has lost her father. It was multiple myeloma, fast enough he didn't suffer, slow enough that he had a chance to see and say good bye with all his loved ones, but even though we know it is the fate of children to outlive their parents, hopefully, since the alternative is even more devastating, we're never ready for it. 

I don't want to run unedited strips of Just Ducky, but I also don't want to stop the comic while my friend does the Bahai version of sitting shiva, so I'm going to be running some strips that don't fall into the actual Just Ducky continuity. Technically, it's filler, but I hope it will be enjoyable. Some of it's new, some of it's going to be reruns, of older comics, refreshers on characters in Just Ducky that newer readers might not remember from previous series, since none of it's on the web anymore except for sale as PDFs on Gumroad. So the important thing is that I will still be update 3 days a week with new blog posts, but I won't have any Just Ducky strips until September 1st and since it doesn't fit into Justy Ducky and the archive auto-updates, I will be posting these to Tumblr, Facebook, the mailing list and Twitter only. If you're not on the mailing list and would like to be, please email me and thank you for your understanding, loosing a immediate family member is so hard.
